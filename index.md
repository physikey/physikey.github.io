## Web3 Native Payment Cards

![Animation](images/animation.gif){: style="width: 100%; height: auto;" }

PhysiKey cards enable secure **Web3 native payments** by leveraging **account abstraction**. These cards regenerate a private key, which then populates a **smart account**, allowing a familiar and seamless transaction execution.

- Fully on chain
- Permissionless
- Interoperable

## Tech Benefits

1. **Easier Card Onboarding**: No banks / No KYC / No Login to get a card.

2. **More Revenue**: Maintain clients full control over revenue splits and fees without owing anything to Visa or Mastercard.

3. **Blockchain Interoperability**: One card works with BTC, ETH, and SOL.

4. **Decentralized Issuance / Distribution**: Users can buy cards from any major online retailer, not needing Visa, Mastercard, or us.

5. **Decentralized Point of Sale Terminals**: Any mobile phone with our technology installed becomes an on chain point of sale terminal.

## How It Works

1. **Card Based Smart Accounts**: Each card acts as a key to a smart account, eliminating the need for traditional seed phrases.
   
2. **Transaction Sponsorship via Pimlico**: We use **Pimlico Paymaster** to cover ERC-20 transaction gas fees, streamlining the payment experience.  
   - A **Pimlico account** is required to use this service.  
   - [Contact us](https://www.physikey.xyz/) to integrate a **custom paymaster** if needed.

With PhysiKey, you can seamlessly integrate **secure** Web3 transactions into your applications. Whether you're issuing new cards or accepting payments, our **familiar card** approach ensures a frictionless user experience.
