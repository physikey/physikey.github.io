![Animation](images/animation.gif){: style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin-top: 32px" }

PhysiKey provides a seamless way to sign and authenticate **Web3** transactions. By leveraging physical cards, PhysiKey enables secure transaction signing for both **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)** and **Simple Smart Accounts (SSAs)** all without the need for traditional seed phrases.

- Secure 
- Permissionless
- Interoperable

## Benefits

1. **Easier Card Onboarding**: No banks / No KYC / No Login to get a card.

2. **Decentralized Issuance / Distribution**: Users can buy cards from any major online retailer, not needing Visa, Mastercard, or us.

3. **Flexible Transactions**: Supports both standard Ethereum accounts (EOA) and smart accounts (SSA).

4. **Interoperability**: One card works with any EVM compatible blockchain.

5. **Simplified Integration**: Developers can easily plug PhysiKey into their dApps for a smooth signing experience.

## How It Works

1. **Private Key Regeneration**: Each card acts as a private key, eliminating the need for traditional key storage.
   
2. **Account Type Flexibility**: EOA Mode signs transactions using the standard key pair. SSA Mode signs transactions through a smart contract wallet using ERC-4337 account abstraction. SSA transactions can be sponored via **Pimlico Paymaster**.
   - A **Pimlico account** is required to use this service.  
   - [Contact us](https://www.physikey.xyz/) to integrate a **custom paymaster** if needed.
