# Overview

## Web3 Native Payment Cards

PhysiKey cards enable secure **Web3 native payments** by leveraging **account abstraction**. These cards regenerate a private key, which then populates a **smart account**, allowing a familiar and seamless transaction execution.

## How It Works

1. **Card-Based Smart Accounts**  
   Each card acts as a key to a smart account, eliminating the need for traditional seed phrases.
   
2. **Transaction Sponsorship via Pimlico**  
   We use **Pimlico Paymaster** to cover ERC-20 transaction gas fees, streamlining the payment experience.  
   - A **Pimlico account** is required to use this service.  
   - [Contact us](https://www.physikey.xyz/) to integrate a **custom paymaster** if needed.


With PhysiKey, you can seamlessly integrate **secure** Web3 transactions into your applications. Whether you're issuing new cards or accepting payments, our **familiar card** approach ensures a frictionless user experience.
